            <h3>The Cause</h3>
            <p>Leith (6) and Bisaso (10) are two young children who are battling a serious medical condition called
              sickle cell anemia. This condition causes their red blood cells to
              become misshapen and unable to carry enough oxygen throughout their bodies. As a result, they are
              constantly tired and in pain, and they are at risk of life-threatening
              complications. They have been surviving on blood donations and transfusions but they have stopped working.
              The boys last hope is a lifesaving bone marrow transplant. However, at a price of $40,000 per child their
              father Obeid cannot
              afford the cost of the transplant on their own, and they desperately need your help. By donating to <a
                href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/my-friend-obeids-2-children">this GoFundMe campaign</a>, you can give
              Leith and Bisaso the chance to
              receive the lifesaving treatment they need and give them the opportunity to live healthy, happy lives.
              Please, help these two brave children by giving what you can today. ANY AMOUNT HELPS!</p>

          <h3>A Plea From Their Father</h3>
          <p>The following email was sent to me by a man I met on one of my humanitarian trips:</p>
          <p>Hope this email finds you well. My name is Obeid Lutale (37yrs), I’m a Ugandan by birth. I work at New
            Vision Printing and Publishing Company Uganda Ltd as a journalist. I am the father of Bisaso Abubaker Lutale
            (10yrs) and Leith Lutale (6yrs). Both of whom were diagnosed with sickle cell anameia at birth. I have had a
            very hard time for the last 10 years, managing day to day life and looking after my two sons who are
            sicklers. Since I am the only earning member of my family with a stay at home wife who’s currently looking
            after our newborn 5 months baby, I am struggling financially to ensure that Leith and Bisaso get the best
            treatment, education and welfare since their life is extremely expensive. Only Leith and Bisaso need $10250
            a year to cover their medication/treatments on time, have a healthy diet daily to maintain their immune
            system since their foods are expensive, keep warm: that is have plenty of jackets, socks, gloves and hydrate
            always, have a place to call home, which place I’m paying rent for as well as security and Bills every month
            at $400. I have financially and mentally been strained and I kindly request any kind support from anywhere
            to help me walk this journey. I buy medication weekly for both children i.e. hydroxyurea, Rectals for pain,
            folic acid, vitamin tablets, iron, argumentim among others, I am in and out of hospitals due to infections,
            checkups every two to three weeks and have IV fluid replacement done.
            I have been advised by the doctors that I can do a Bone marrow transplant which is very costly at $40.000
            per child of which I can't afford. With the influenza outbreak in schools, this has made the situation even
            worse. I’ve been in and out of hospital with Leith who suffered a severe infection and had a crisis too
            which left him very skinny almost to the bone. He has been in hospital several times where he was given
            multiple pain medications due to his condition, blood transfusion among others, followed by out patient
            medication and this was very costly that until now I haven't been able to clear the debt on top of the usual
            routine. Soon after Abubaker fell sick too and we were back to hospital for outpatient treatment which was
            costly as well. Abubaker and Leith have to drink water and fresh juice on a daily, I purchase so many fruits
            to make juice on a daily or eat, for them to boost up their immunity, buy groceries among others which are
            costly with the cost of living going high. The children also have a caretaker who helps their mum and she is
            paid monthly.

            I am writing this email to request for your support/assistance: financial assistance, donations of any kind
            or anything you think can be of use in any way for my children.

            I pray that God allows you to do so in any capacity and I will appreciate your response in this regard.

            Kind regards

            Obeid Lutale </p>
