            <h3>Why This Is Close To Me</h3>
            <p>A few years ago I was on one of my many humanitarian trips. This time to Uganda. I was traveling to many remote villages teaching about Feminine periods, Cycle beads and “Days for Girls” pads.
              A young reporter, Lutale Obeid, who works for New Vision Printing and Publishing Company Uganda Ltd was traveling with me and documented my trip to show a report on tv.
              As we traveled I learned of his 2 sons who both suffer from sickle cell anemia. I learned of the many times he has had to spend all his savings on buying blood to give the boys a blood transfusion.
              They are getting worse!!! Their visits to the hospital are becoming more and more frequent. They need a full bone marrow transplant in order to survive. The doctors have authorized the surgery, we just need the funds. $40,000 per child. A crazy amount we cannot reach alone.
              If you at all can help this cause it is greatly appreciated. We are all trying to do what we can but need your help please.</p>

            <h3>Their Story</h3>
            <p>Leith (6) and Bisaso (10) are two young children who are battling a serious medical condition called
              sickle cell anemia. This condition causes their red blood cells to
              become misshapen and unable to carry enough oxygen throughout their bodies. As a result, they are
              constantly tired and in pain, and they are at risk of life-threatening
              complications. They have been surviving on blood donations and transfusions but they have stopped working.
              The boys last hope is a lifesaving bone marrow transplant. However, at a price of $40,000 per child their
              father Obeid cannot
              afford the cost of the transplant on their own, and they desperately need your help. By donating to <a style="background-color:#008cff"
              href="https://accounts.venmo.com/u/PernilleReamn">Venmo</a> or <a

              Leith and Bisaso the chance to
              receive the lifesaving treatment they need and give them the opportunity to live healthy, happy lives.
              Please, help these two brave children by giving what you can today. ANY AMOUNT HELPS!</p>

          <h3>A Plea From Their Father</h3>
          <p>My name is Obeid Lutale (37yrs), I’m a Ugandan by birth. I work at New
            Vision Printing and Publishing Company Uganda Ltd as a journalist. I am the father of Bisaso Abubaker Lutale
            (10yrs) and Leith Lutale (6yrs). Both of whom were diagnosed with sickle cell anemeia at birth. I have had a
            very hard time for the last 10 years, managing day to day life and looking after my two sons who are
            sick. I am the only earning member of my family. My wife is currently looking
            after our newborn 5 month old baby. I am struggling financially to ensure that Leith and Bisaso get the best
            treatment, education, and welfare since their life is extremely expensive. Leith and Bisaso need $10,250
            a year to cover their medications and treatments. They need to have have a healthy diet and hydrate always to maintain their immune
            system. To keep warm we need to have plenty of jackets, socks, and gloves. We have a place to call home, which I’m paying rent for as well as security and bills every month
            at $400. I have financially and mentally been strained and I kindly request any kind support from anywhere
            to help me walk this journey. I buy medications weekly for both children i.e. hydroxyurea, rectals for pain,
            folic acid, vitamin tablets, iron, argumentim among others. I am in and out of hospitals due to infections,
            checkups every two to three weeks, and have IV fluid replacements done.</p>
            <p>
            I have been advised by the doctors that I can do a bone marrow transplant which is very costly at $40,000
            per child which I can't afford. With the influenza outbreak in schools, this has made the situation even
            worse. I’ve been in and out of hospital with Leith who suffered a severe infection and had a crisis too
            which left him very skinny almost to the bone. He has been in hospital several times where he was given
            multiple pain medications. Due to his condition, blood transfusion among others, followed by outpatient
            medication this was very costly. Until now I haven't been able to clear the debt. Soon after Bisaso fell 
            sick too and we were back to hospital for outpatient treatment which was
            costly as well. The children also have a caretaker who helps their mum and she is paid monthly.</p>
            <p>
            I am writing this to request your financial assistance. Donations of any kind
            can be of use for my children.
              </p><p>
            I pray that God allows you to do so in any capacity.
</p>
<p>
            Kind regards
</p><p>
